 I didn’t join them on their jaunts, my friends,
 Never launched a clanging raid on the chainlink
 Around some prohibited place, never scrambled
 Through the backlit wood toward some worthless view
 
 For the thrill, never courted needless danger,
 Never fought for the pure blood buzz.
 Nothing unplotted appealed to me.
 I would not dive in the dark.
 
 Instead, I waited in the lot, by the gate, on the dock.
 Half-hiding, I invented the senselessness of their racing,
 Erasing in advance the force of their findings.
 Vaguely concerned with my record, with pain,
 
 I convinced myself I was a thing to be saved,
 Believing some precious design had fixed
 A better calling to consume me until
 The night was eclipsed by my friends’ laughing return—
 
 <turn>No</turn> greater cause set out for me.
 Nothing staked itself past the redundant dream
 Of careless offering, no grand conviction came to me
 Though I sense how nothing can happen for so long,
 
 How unrisked life yawns,
 How some night, unannounced,
 I will struggle past the breakers, feeling only
 Then why I let the waves bring my body in—

 Underscoring its reflective, ultimately empowered tone, the
 title of Mike Thuene’s “Apology” refers to the concept of
 “apologia pro vita sua,” a defense of one’s life. Such an
 inspired defense of self, derived from contemplation of past
 timidity, follows a significant poetic turn—a prime example of
 the retrospective-prospective structure which Mark Yakich
 describes as “a two-part structure that begins with a
 retrospective consideration of the past and then concludes with
 a prospective look at the present, or even with a prediction or
 hope for the future.” Yakich also notes that such turns are
 “[a]lmost always…signaled by grammatical shifts,” and while the
 narrator’s turn-inducing declaration of “No” does not
 immediately appear to have such an effect, a shift to the
 present tense does indeed occur in that same, penultimate
 stanza: “I sense how nothing can happen for so long.” As with
 many turns (retrospective-prospective and otherwise), the
 thematic shift in “Apology” from scrutinizing reminiscence to
 promising recognition of the benefits which accompany risk also
 involves an escalation, or revving up, near the poem’s end.
 With yet another change in tense, the narrator turns his gaze
 toward the future and resolves to overcome those paralyzing
 trepidations of his youth: “I will struggle past the breakers,
 feeling only / Then why I let the waves bring my body in—.”
