 Western wind when wilt thou blow,
 The small rain down can rain?
 <turn>Christ</turn>, if my love were in my arms
 And I in my bed again!

 Referred to by Jerry Harp as “a primal cry of English literary
 tradition,” the anonymous “Western Wind” contains a momentous
 tonal shift in its four lines, hinging on the third line’s
 opening exclamation of “Christ.” Following an initial plea to
 the personified elemental powers of wind and rain, this strange
 shout, “the ambiguity of the opening cry of ‘Christ,’” grants
 the poem’s latter half a great deal of distinct “tonal
 complexity”; as Harp writes, “[‘Christ’] functions as both
 angry expletive and prayerful invocation.” Further intricacy is
 derived from the narrator’s apparent desire to be in bed with
 his beloved, implying, naturally, “closeness of a more carnal
 kind,” but also, as Harp explains, a broader emotional longing:
 “…I take it that what he longs for is an intimacy, a feeling of
 belonging, that integrates every part of his experience, from
 the greatest heights of spiritual harmony to the greatest
 depths of physical union.” Although this poem lacks the total
 “shift in genre” wrought by some mid-course turns, its drastic
 change in tone—this “dramatic shift in the poem’s implied
 world”—nonetheless makes “Western Wind” a prime example of what
 Harp describes as the particularly “radical” nature of 
 mid-course turns.
