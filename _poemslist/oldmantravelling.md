 - 
 The little hedge-row birds,
 That peck along the road, regard him not.
 He travels on, and in his face, his step,
 His gait, is one expression; every limb,
 His look and bending figure, all bespeak
 A man who does not move with pain, but moves
 With thought—He is insensibly subdued
 To settled quiet: he is one by whom
 All effort seems forgotten, one to whom
 Long patience has such mild composure given,
 That patience now doth seem a thing, of which
 He hath no need. He is by nature led
 To peace so perfect, that the young behold
 With envy, what the old man hardly feels.
 <turn>—I asked him</turn> whither he was bound, and what
 The object of his journey; he replied
 "Sir! I am going many miles to take
 A last leave of my son, a mariner,
 Who from a sea-fight has been brought to Falmouth,
 And there is dying in an hospital."

 The mid-course turn occurs in line 15–that is, after the poem’s
 completed blank verse sonnet–at which point the old man, who is (so
 far) merely the object of the projections of the poem’s (so far
 only) speaker, is called upon and allowed to speak, and what he
 says radically overturns the projections of the poem’s first 14
 lines.  A wonderful, and wonderfully succinct, reading of “Old Man
 Travelling” can be found in Geoffrey Hartman’s “The Sympathy
 Paradox: Poetry, Feeling, and Modern Cultural Morality,” an essay
 collected in his The Fateful Question of Culture (New York:
 Columbia University Press, 1997), pp. 141-64.
