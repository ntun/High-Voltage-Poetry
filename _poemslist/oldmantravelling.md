 	The little hedge-row birds,
 That peck along the road, regard him not.
 He travels on, and in his face, his step,
 His gait, is one expression; every limb,
 His look and bending figure, all bespeak
 A man who does not move with pain, but moves
 With thought—He is insensibly subdued
 To settled quiet: he is one by whom
 All effort seems forgotten, one to whom
 Long patience has such mild composure given,
 That patience now doth seem a thing, of which
 He hath no need. He is by nature led
 To peace so perfect, that the young behold
 With envy, what the old man hardly feels.
 —<turn>I</turn> asked him whither he was bound, and what
 The object of his journey; he replied
 "Sir! I am going many miles to take
 A last leave of my son, a mariner,
 Who from a sea-fight has been brought to Falmouth,
 And there is dying in an hospital."

 Exemplifying what Jerry Harp deems the “radical” tendency of
 mid-course turns to dramatically transform a poem, “Old Man
 Travelling” by William Wordsworth is noticeably divided by such
 a shift into two distinct and contradictory segments. While the
 poem’s first fourteen lines constitute a blank verse sonnet on
 the imagined sagacity and inner tranquility of that titular old
 man, who, “…is by nature led / To peace so perfect,” the poem’s
 fifteenth line constitutes an absolute tonal, thematic, and
 structural shift. Whereas the old man exists in the poem’s
 opening as “merely the object of the projections of the poem’s
 (so far only) speaker,” the narrator’s misguided assumptions
 are at this point “radically overturn[ed],” as the old man
 himself is granted a voice. Far from the content, guru-like
 wanderer depicted in the poem’s original description, this
 elderly traveler’s actual words reveal that he is en route to
 take “last leave of [his] son,” who is “dying in an hospital.”
 Thus, the sonnet which begins “Old Man Travelling” is exposed
 as sheer fantastical fallacy, and the immense power of the 
 mid-course turn is unmistakably demonstrated.
