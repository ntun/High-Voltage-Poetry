 In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes,
 I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods,
 Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook,
 To please the desert and the sluggish brook.
 The purple petals fallen in the pool
 Made the black water with their beauty gay;
 Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool,
 And court the flower that cheapens his array.
 <turn>Rhodora</turn>! if the sages ask thee why
 This charm is wasted on the earth and sky,
 Tell them, dear, that, if eyes were made for seeing,
 Then beauty is its own excuse for Being;
 Why thou wert there, O rival of the rose!
 I never thought to ask; I never knew;
 But in my simple ignorance suppose
 The self-same power that brought me there, brought you.

 Derived from Emerson’s signature transcendentalist vision of
 nature, “The Rhodora” serves as a pristine example of the
 emblem structure which Michael Theune describes in Structure &
 Surprise as “[a] two-part structure, [that] begins with an
 organized description of an object and culminates with a
 meditation on that same object.” Indeed, Emerson’s poem begins
 with more descriptive language—the narrator’s discovery of an
 immaculate shrub depicted through “leafless blooms” and “purple
 petals”—and concludes, following the pivotal exclamation of
 “Rhodora!,” with an insightful address to the anthropomorphized
 plant itself. This emblem structure, which Thuene says, “moves
 from sight to insight, from perception to reflection,” is
 heightened by the fact that the poem functions, essentially, as
 a 16-line sonnet. As with a number of Shakespearean sonnets,
 “The Rhodora” includes an additional twist in its final
 couplet, and, from “reflection” on the rhodora’s beautiful
 state of being, culminates in theological consideration of a
 common Maker uniting flora and fauna: “The self-same power that
 brought me there, brought you.”
