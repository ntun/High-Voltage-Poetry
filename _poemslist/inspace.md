 In space
 (the experiment suggested by two fifth graders),
 a Canadian astronaut
 wrings water out of a towel.

 It stays by the towel,
 horizontal
 transparent isinglass,
 a hyaline column.

 Then begins to cover his hands,
 his wrists,
 stays on them
 until he passes it to another towel.

 <turn>On earth</turn>
 some who watch this
 recognize the wrung, irrational soul.

 How it does not leave
 but stays close,
 outside the cleaning twist-fate but close—

 fear     desire     anger
 joy     irritation
 mourning

 wet stuff
 that is shining, that cannot go from us,
 having nowhere other to fall.

 Hirshfield’s poem begins as a seemingly straightforward description of <a
 href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8TssbmY-GM">a real-life experiment</a>
 conducted by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield aboard the International Space
 Station. However, while this playful demonstration of zero gravity is all well and
 good, the poet seemingly has more ethereal destinations in mind. With the words “On
 earth,” the poem eschews the strangeness of outer space, turning—momentarily—toward
 the terrestrial, and thus twisting the experiment’s revelation into a metaphor for
 the soul, the emotions that, on the one hand, make up almost all of who we are but,
 on the other, also cannot cohere without us. Water droplets, suspended weightless
 around a wrung towel, and hands, and wrists—and, by extension, the entire body, the
 whole self—become those unshakeable emotions—so-called “wet stuff”—which surround
 and define human existence. “In Space” thus offers a prime example of a metaphor-to
 meaning poetic turn, as the simple act of resetting this poem “On earth” reveals
 another layer of meaning, and redefines those prior lines as symbolic language.
