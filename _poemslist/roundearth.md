    At the round earth's imagin'd corners, blow
    Your trumpets, angels, and arise, arise
    From death, you numberless infinities
    Of souls, and to your scatter'd bodies go;
    All whom the flood did, and fire shall o'erthrow,
    All whom war, dearth, age, agues, tyrannies,
    Despair, law, chance hath slain, and you whose eyes
    Shall behold God and never taste death's woe.
    <turn>But</turn> let them sleep, Lord, and me mourn a space,
    For if above all these my sins abound,
    'Tis late to ask abundance of thy grace
    When we are there; here on this lowly ground
    Teach me how to repent; for that's as good
    As if thou'hadst seal'd my pardon with thy blood.

 Living up to its designation as one of Donne’s Holy Sonnets,
 this poem’s opening octave draws from the morbid grandeur of
 the Biblically prophesized Armageddon, in which “numberless
 infinities / Of souls” return to their “scatter’d bodies.” At
 the commencement of its closing sestet, however, Donne’s poem
 undergoes its own sudden, unexpected transformation, as
 startling apocalyptic language is replaced by the narrator’s
 penitent introspection—a humble prayer for personal salvation.
 Such a turn exemplifies what Jerry Harp calls the particularly
 “sharp” and “radical” nature of mid-course turns. In his entry
 “Volta” in The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics,
 T.V.F. Brogan captures the immensity of this particular,
 arresting turn, as he writes, “One can hardly imagine any
 stronger v. [volta] than that between the octave and sestet in
 Donne’s Holy Sonnet VII, which marks a momentous shift from the
 imagined scene of Judgement Day, cosmic in scale, to the quiet
 immediacy of the here and now, the narrator deep in thought.”
 Indeed, with its sudden tonal about-face, Donne’s sonnet
 exemplifies the near-unlimited capacity of mid-course turns to
 shockingly overthrow a poem’s initial character. With the mere
 introduction of the word “But,” the enormity of the end times—
 rampaging angels and undead hordes—gives way to the present
 concerns of a prayerful, repentant narrator.
